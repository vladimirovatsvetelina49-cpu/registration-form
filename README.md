## What I Practiced
- HTML form structure (`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`)  
- Associating labels with inputs for accessibility  
- Using required fields and placeholders  
- Grouping related inputs with fieldsets  
- Basic CSS for styling forms  

##  Next Steps
- Improve design with Flexbox/Grid for layout  
- Add form validation with JavaScript  
- Experiment with different themes (dark/light mode)
